"""
On non-Windows platforms (using "setup.py install", "setup.py develop",
or by using EasyInstall), a "pyfdax" script will be installed that opens up
a terminal and imports "main" from pyfdax.py. 
main() is called with no arguments, and the return value is passed to sys.exit(), so an errorlevel or message to print
to stderr could be provided (not implemented yet).

pyfdax_no_term does essentially the same but it starts no terminal.

On Windows, a set of pyfdax.exe and pyfdax_no_term.exe launchers are created,
alongside a set of pyfdax.py and pyfdax_no_term.pyw files. The .exe wrappers find
and execute the right version of Python to run the .py or .pyw file.
